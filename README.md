# GEOG5995_Final_Project
## Background
The price factors influencing housing prices are diverse, encompassing transportation infrastructure, geographical elements, and the level of public safety. An essential indicator reflecting public safety is the quantity of criminal cases. In this endeavor, our project aims to investigate the relationship between housing prices and the incidence of criminal cases in the Leeds area through data visualization.

## Data
The dataset utilized in the code comprises four distinct sets:
2023_crime_data_west_yorkshire.csv
house_price_by_LSOA.xls
map_leeds.gpkg
oa_leeds.gpkg

## Code
All of the code is contained in data_visualization.ipynb, including detailed processes such as data preprocessing, data merging, and plotting. The code includes detailed comments on the process flow, and below are two graphs generated based on the aforementioned four datasets.
